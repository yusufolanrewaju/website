## Features
### Responsive Design
This website is built with responsiveness in mind. Regardless of your device screen size, whether you're on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, the content adapts gracefully to provide an optimal viewing experience.
### Media Queries
Exploiting the power of media queries in CSS, I've tailored styles to different devices, ensuring readability and aesthetics are maintained throughout.
### Mobile-First Approach
Embracing a mobile-first idea, this design prioritizes mobile users, then scales up for larger screens. This approach enhances performance and accessibility.
### Interactive Elements
JavaScript adds dynamic features, making the site not just visually appealing but also functionally rich. From smooth transitions to interactive forms, it's a web experience designed for everyone. With this, I added effects of the sliding portfolio width to the website.
